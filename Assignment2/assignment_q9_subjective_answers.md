**Gradient descent**

Learning rate:-0.01

Number of iterations:-100

Learning rate function over time:- Constant

Batch size=30

- Including Bias

    - RMSE:-0.991
    - MSE:-0.772

- Without Bias

    - RMSE:-0.957
    - MSE:-0.726

For normal equation it will show error that XT.X is a singular matrix. While it works for gradient descent efficiently.
